# InterSessions
A streamlined prayer list

Team Members: Dan Morse, Liz Ferguson 

App Name: InterSessions

App Description: *Who do you pray for when you sit down for a session of prayer? What do they need you to be lifting up during this session? If you don't have time for digging out your paper journal, or trying to remember what they said, InterSessions is for you. InterSessions is a streamlined, fast, easy to use app for tracking the people you pray for and their requests. It should be self-explanatory, and completely intuitive to use. Focus on praying, not wrangling a list.*

Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?) Anyone who prays.
